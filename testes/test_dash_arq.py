    # Sharing State Between Callbacks
    > This is the *6th* chapter of the essential [Dash Tutorial](/).  The
    > [previous chapter](/interactive-graphing) covered how to use callbacks
    > with the `dash_core_components.Graph` component.  The [rest of the Dash

    > frequently asked questions and gotchas.
    One of the core Dash principles explained in the
    [Getting Started Guide on Callbacks](/getting-started-part-2)
    is that **Dash Callbacks must never modify variables outside of their
    scope**. It is not safe to modify any `global` variables.
    This chapter explains why and provides some alternative patterns for
    sharing state between callbacks.
    ## Why Share State?
    In some apps, you may have multiple callbacks that depend on expensive data
    processing tasks like making SQL queries,
    running simulations, or downloading data.
    Rather than have each callback run the same expensive task,
    you can have one callback run the task and then share the
    results to the rest of the callbacks.
    This need has been somewhat ameliorated now that you can have
    [multiple outputs](/getting-started-part-2) for one callback. This way,
    that expensive task can be done once and immediately used in all the
    outputs. But in some cases this still isn't ideal, for example if there are
    simple follow-on tasks that modify the results, like unit conversions. We
    shouldn't need to repeat a large database query just to change the results
    from Fahrenheit to Celsius!

    ## Why `global` variables will break your app
    Dash is designed to work in multi-user environments
    where multiple people may view the application at the
    same time and will have **independent sessions**.
    If your app uses modified `global` variables,
    then one user's session could set the variable to one value
    which would affect the next user's session.
    Dash is also designed to be able to run with **multiple python
    workers** so that callbacks can be executed in parallel.
    This is commonly done with `gunicorn` using syntax like
    ```
    $ gunicorn --workers 4 app:server
    ```
    (`app` refers to a file named `app.py` and `server` refers to a variable
    in that file named `server`: `server = app.server`).
    When Dash apps run across multiple workers, their memory
    _is not shared_. This means that if you modify a global
    variable in one callback, that modification will not be
    applied to the rest of the workers.

        ## Sharing Data Between Callbacks
        In order to share data safely across multiple python
        processes, we need to store the data somewhere that is accessible to
        each of the processes.
        There are three main places to store this data:
        1 - In the user's browser session
        2 - On the disk (e.g. on a file or on a new database)
        3 - In a shared memory space like with Redis
        The following three examples illustrate these approaches.
        ## Example 1 - Storing Data in the Browser with a Hidden Div
        To save data in user's browser's session:
        - Implemented by saving the data as part of Dash's front-end store
          through methods explained in
          [https://community.plot.ly/t/sharing-a-dataframe-between-plots/6173](https://community.plot.ly/t/sharing-a-dataframe-between-plots/6173)
        - Data has to be converted to a string like JSON for storage and transport
        - Data that is cached in this way will _only be available in the
          user's current session_.
          - If you open up a new browser, the app's callbacks will always
            compute the data. The data is only cached and transported between
            callbacks within the session.
          - As such, unlike with caching, this method doesn't increase the
            memory footprint of the app.
          - There could be a cost in network transport. If you're sharing 10MB
            of data between callbacks, then that data will be transported over
            the network between each callback.
           - If the network cost is too high, then compute the aggregations
             upfront and transport those.
             Your app likely won't be displaying 10MB of data,
             it will just be displaying a subset or an aggregation of it.

        This example outlines how you can perform an expensive data processing
        step in one callback, serialize the output at JSON, and provide it
        as an input to the other callbacks. This example uses standard Dash
        callbacks and stores the JSON-ified data inside a hidden div in
        the app.

        can also be expensive.
        In many cases, your app will only display a subset or an aggregation
        of the computed or filtered data. In these cases, you could precompute

        ## Example 3 - Caching and Signaling
        This example:
        - Uses Redis via Flask-Cache for storing “global variables”.
          This data is accessed through a function, the output of which is
          cached and keyed by its input arguments.
        - Uses the hidden div solution to send a signal to the other
          callbacks when the expensive computation is complete.
        - Note that instead of Redis, you could also save this to the file
          system. See https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
          for more details.
        - This “signaling” is cool because it allows the expensive
          computation to only take up one process.
          Without this type of signaling, each callback could end up
          computing the expensive computation in parallel,
          locking four processes instead of one.
        This approach is also advantageous in that future sessions can
        use the pre-computed value.
        This will work well for apps that have a small number of inputs.
        Here’s what this example looks like. Some things to note:
        - I’ve simulated an expensive process by using a time.sleep(5).
        - When the app loads, it takes five seconds to render all four graphs.
        - The initial computation only blocks one process.
        - Once the computation is complete, the signal is sent and four callbacks
          are executed in parallel to render the graphs.
          Each of these callbacks retrieves the data from the
          “global store”: the Redis or filesystem cache.
        - I’ve set processes=6 in app.run_server so that multiple callbacks
          can be executed in parallel. In production, this is done with
          something like $ gunicorn --workers 6 --threads 2 app:server
        - Selecting a value in the dropdown will take less than five seconds
          if it has already been selected in the past.
          This is because the value is being pulled from the cache.
        - Similarly, reloading the page or opening the app in a new window
          is also fast because the initial state and the initial expensive
          computation has already been computed.

        One way to do this is to save the data in a hidden `Div`,
        as demonstrated in the first example.
        Another way to do this is to save the data on the
        filesystem cache with a session ID and then reference the data
        using that session ID. Because data is saved on the server
        instead of transported over the network, this method is generally faster than the
        "hidden div" method.
        This example was originally discussed in a
        [Dash Community Forum thread](https://community.plot.ly/t/capture-window-tab-closing-event/7375/2?u=chriddyp).
        This example:
        - Caches data using the `flask_caching` filesystem cache. You can also save to an in-memory database like Redis.
        - Serializes the data as JSON.
            - If you are using Pandas, consider serializing
            with Apache Arrow. [Community thread](https://community.plot.ly/t/fast-way-to-share-data-between-callbacks/8024/2)
        - Saves session data up to the number of expected concurrent users.
        This prevents the cache from being overfilled with data.
        - Creates unique session IDs by embedding a hidden random string into
        the app's layout and serving a unique layout on every page load.

        There are three things to notice in this example:
        - The timestamps of the dataframe don't update when we retrieve
        the data. This data is cached as part of the user's session.
        - Retrieving the data initially takes five seconds but successive queries
        are instant, as the data has been cached.
        - The second session displays different data than the first session:
        the data that is shared between callbacks is isolated to individual
        user sessions.
